#Rauj's Pain(t) Version 0.1.2 - 10/7/2023

New features:
* Undo and Redo - this MUST use at least (more is ok) one "stack" (this is an abstract data structure in Java)
* provide a blank starting image and a clear canvas (with "are you sure" check) tool
* draw an additional shape of your choice
* have an eraser tool
* be able to draw a regular side polygon with any # of sides
* select and copy/paste a piece of the image
* select and move a piece of the image




Expected next version:
* have at least 3 unit tests. 
* have a timer that allows for autosave.  (threading not required but probably a good idea)
The timer's countdown shall be optionally (as in some way to choose on/off) visible to the user.  Bonus/optional: Reset the timer on a user's save.
* have some JavaDoc commenting. 
* have the ability to save in an alternative file format than the one that was the original for the image.
* have a warning image features/data loss can happen 



Issues With Code: 
* allow the addition of text from user-typed input to your image.
* cant easily move snipped objects
* smart saving issues

Critique of my Code:

I have done a better job of seperating my code with classes. No class reaches 1000 lines of code. I am still lacking much documenting/commenting. I have a few cases where I could clean up by creating new methods but I think I have a decent clean code. 7/10
