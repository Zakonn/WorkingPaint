#Rauj's Pain(t) Version 0.2.0 - 11/5/2023

New features:
* allow you to rotate (90/180/270) an image, as well as mirror [as in, do a horizontal and vertical flip (so, left becomes right / top becomes bottom).]
* allow the rotate of either a selection (a chunk) or for your whole canvas.  [that is a both of those]
* have icons for drawing tools; preferred is all buttons, etc.  (you may retain existing text labels if you want or add if you have icons already).
* notifications (as in in the corner of window, from the OS); for autosave - trigger or on off.
* have tool tips for your buttons that appear on hover.



Expected next version:
* fix bugs with canvas size
* better organization of tools on toolbar
* add more icons 
* add more shapes to draw



Issues With Code: 
* bugs with canvas size 
* not all icons match with each other
* OnClose does not stop app from running
