#Rauj's Pain(t) Version 0.1.3 - 10/18/2023

New features:
* The software shall have at least 3 unit tests.
* The software shall have a timer that allows for autosave.  (threading not required but probably a good idea)
* The timer's countdown shall be optionally (as in some way to choose on/off) visible to the user.  Bonus/optional: Reset the timer on a user's save.
* The code shall have some JavaDoc commenting.
* The software shall have the ability to save in an alternative file format than the one that was the original for the image.




Expected next version:
* allow you to rotate (90/180/270) an image, as well as mirror [as in, do a horizontal and vertical flip (so, left becomes right / top becomes bottom).]
* allow the rotate of either a selection (a chunk) or for your whole canvas.  [that is a both of those]
* have icons for drawing tools; preferred is all buttons, etc.  (you may retain existing text labels if you want or add if you have icons already).
* notifications (as in in the corner of window, from the OS); for autosave - trigger or on off.
* have tool tips for your buttons that appear on hover.



Issues With Code:
* issues with loading application on MAC
* works flawlessly on windows

missing features:
* needs notifications of when save is done
* smart saving issues
